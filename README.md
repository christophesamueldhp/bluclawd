# bluclawd

A feature layer for [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi), installed as an
ordinary pi package — not a fork. **Nothing here modifies a file pi owns**, and
nothing here bundles pi's own source: install pi normally, then install this on
top.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g --ignore-scripts @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent   # pi itself
pi install /path/to/this/repo                                     # this layer
pi                                                                 # run it
```

Identity is plain pi — `~/.pi/agent`, the `pi` binary. The name "bluclawd"
shows up in the welcome banner and nowhere else; there is no rebrand.

## How it works

Two mechanisms, both pi's own:

| Need | pi's mechanism |
|---|---|
| What ships | `package.json`'s `pi.extensions` — an explicit, ordered list of files (`permissions` must load first: it must see `tool_call` before anything that might answer it) |
| What a feature does | `ExtensionAPI`: `registerCommand`, `registerTool`, `registerShortcut`, `appendEntry` + `registerEntryRenderer`, `ui.custom`, `setHeader`, `switchSession`, `resources_discover`, … |

`bin.mjs` is a convenience entry point for trying this out without a separate
`pi install` (imports `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` as a normal
dependency); it is not how `pi install` loads this package.

## What ships

```
package.json    the pi package manifest (pi.extensions, dependencies)
bin.mjs         convenience entry point for local runs
themes/         the bluclawd theme
daemon/         FleetView's session daemon
ext/            the feature layer
  _shared/      settings readers/writers, process runner, vendored pi internals
test/           self-contained — no monorepo, no fixtures pi doesn't publish
```

14 extensions: `permissions`, `statusline`, `memory`,
`checkpoints`, `subagents`, `web`, `mcp`, `sandbox`, `background-bash`,
`branding`, `diagnostics`, `fleet`, `help`,
`history-search`.

## Updating

```bash
npm update    # bump the @earendil-works/pi-* peer/dev dependency versions
npm test      # confirm nothing broke against the new pi
```

There is no upstream merge here — this repo owns no pi source to merge into.
The dependency this actually has on pi's internals: `ext/_shared/` vendors a
handful of small pi functions/tables that pi does not export publicly
(`stripAnsi`, `openBrowser`, path getters, the built-in slash-command list, the
keybindings action-name table, a security-relevant path resolver, MCP
auth-header resolution). Each is documented in its own file with what drifts
if pi changes it — mostly cosmetic (a stale `/help` line), one
(`path-resolve.ts`) copied whole rather than trimmed because it backs
permission rule matching. `npm run typecheck && npm test` after a pi version
bump is what would actually catch a break.

## Running and checking it

```bash
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint        # biome check .
npm test            # vitest
node --experimental-strip-types scripts/probe-extensions.ts   # what each extension registers
```

## What this layer cannot do

Recorded so nobody re-litigates it. Each was found by running the thing, not by
reading the API:

- **Hidden command aliases are impossible.** `registerCommand` has no alias
  field, and pi's `input` event fires only after the interactive command chain.
  Commands here have their canonical name only.
- **An extension cannot rebind a pi keybinding.** Permission-mode cycling is
  **Alt+M**, not Claude Code's Shift+Tab, which pi binds to
  `app.thinking.cycle`; pi refuses the registration and logs a conflict.
- **An extension cannot add a theme colour.** The `acceptEdits` badge uses
  `success` rather than a dedicated token.
- **An extension-contributed theme cannot be the startup theme.** pi resolves
  the configured theme before extensions contribute their paths, so it falls
  back to dark and prints "Theme not found" once; `branding` re-applies it
  after discovery.
- **`newSession()` takes neither a directory nor a model**, so FleetView's "New
  session" panel says which part of the choice it could not honour.

Deliberately not ported: **PDF input** (would mean reimplementing four
provider wire formats behind `before_provider_request` — a shared-type change
in pi's own `packages/ai`, not reachable through the extension API at all).
